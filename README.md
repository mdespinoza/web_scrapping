# Web Scrapping Script
## The purpose of this repo was to develop a python script that is able to extract data from a web page.

### You will find 2 Primary Folders: 
- code_example 
  - This folder you will find a jupyter notebook file where I break down the script and you can follow step by step
    - Version 1 utilizes beautifulsoup as the primary package for web scrapping
    - Version 2 utilizes Selenium as the primary package for web scrapping

- final_functional_code
  - This folder you will find a python script that can be ran for web scrapping data from a website. (Feel free to modify as needed) 
    - Pay attention to the variables that need to be renamed if needed and how they are used in the functions. 


### UPDATE 
- Created a new version (Version 2) that is directed towards pulling data from Google Search with more content and then export the data via a csv file (could use some cleaning up though - but don't need to for my work)
