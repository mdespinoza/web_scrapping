# Web Scrapping Script
## The purpose of this repo was to develop a python script that is able to extract data from a web page.



### You will find 2 folders having: 
- code_example 
  - This folder you will find a jupyter notebook file where I break down the script and you can follow step by step

- final_functional_code
  - This folder you will find a python script that can be ran for web scrapping data from a website. (Feel free to modify as needed)  


### UPDATE 
- Created a new version that is directed towards pulling data from Google Search
  - Google has more up-to-date information
